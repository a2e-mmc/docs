WRF to SOWFA Data Conversion
============================

TOOF
----
A FORTRAN-based utility...

BCs, ICs

roughness mapping

still need estimate of background pressure


SOWFA Boundary Data
===================

`datatools.SOWFA.constant.boundaryData` contains classes for dealing with
OpenFOAM boundary data used by the `timeVaryingMapped*` class of boundary
conditions.

`BoundaryData` class
--------------------
For reading in existing boundaryData files generated by OpenFOAM sampling. Note
that the data points are assumed to lie on a regular grid (so the number of
horizontal and vertical points are constant).

`CartesianPatch` class
----------------------
For writing out simple boundaryData, with fields that only vary with time and
height.
