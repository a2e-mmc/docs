Most of the Python utilities referenced here, unless otherwise noted, are part
of the `NWTC datatools repo <https://github.com/NWTC/datatools>`_ managed by

mmctools
========

Throughout the MMC project, several functions for analysis and assessment have been developed by the team and shared through `GitHub <https://github.com/a2e-mmc/mmctools/tree/master/mmctools>`_ for the broader community.
The functions and classes are collectively referred to as **mmctools** and are separated into the following categories:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   mmctools/measurements 
   mmctools/coupling 
   mmctools/wrf
   mmctools/helper_functions
   mmctools/plotting


WRF to SOWFA Data Conversion
============================

TOOF
----
A FORTRAN-based utility...

BCs, ICs

roughness mapping

still need estimate of background pressure


SOWFA Boundary Data
===================

`datatools.SOWFA.constant.boundaryData` contains classes for dealing with
OpenFOAM boundary data used by the `timeVaryingMapped*` class of boundary
conditions.

`BoundaryData` class
--------------------
For reading in existing boundaryData files generated by OpenFOAM sampling. Note
that the data points are assumed to lie on a regular grid (so the number of
horizontal and vertical points are constant).

`CartesianPatch` class
----------------------
For writing out simple boundaryData, with fields that only vary with time and
height.

.. Indices and tables
