Project Overview
****************

The Mesoscale to Microscale Coupling (MMC) Project was designed to build new high-performance-computing-based multiscale wind plant simulation tools coupling a broad range of scales.
The scale interactions enable the optimization needed to ensure the efficient, reliable production and integration of future wind-generated electricity.

.. admonition:: Technical Merit

  * Successful models of wind plants require forcing from the larger-scale atmospheric flow to capture the full range of energy-containing flow, including nonstationary motions
  * Integrating the full range of scales allows optimization of wind plant siting, design, and operation
  * The resulting tools will be applicable to diverse locations and operating conditions, as required to support wind energy integration at future high penetration levels

Objectives
==========

* Establish a validation framework with well-defined performance metrics, and apply it to benchmark wind-plant simulation cases
* Improve the current state-of-the-science of coupling mesoscale information into high-fidelity HPC-based wind-plant simulations to reduce error in predicting wind speed and turbulence characteristics
* Disseminate methods with stakeholders
* Verify and Validate results using formal and reproducible techniques
* Quantify the uncertainty in the results

Participating Laboratories
==========================

* Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL; Lead Lab)
* Argonne National Lab (ANL)
* Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL)
* Los Alamos National Lab (LANL)
* National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR; sponsored by National Science Foundation)
