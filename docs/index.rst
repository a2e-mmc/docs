Mesoscale-Microscale Coupling Manual
====================================

This documentation describes ongoing work on the Atmosphere to 
Electrons (A2e) mesoscale-microscale coupling (MMC) project. These 
docs will provide overviews of the numerical models utilized within 
the MMC project, information for running various case studies 
(including model setups, auxiliary input, pre- and post-processing 
code, and assessment notebooks), and general python utilities that 
have been developed within this project.
