Mesoscale-to-Microscale Coupling
================================

This documentation describes the work completed within the U.S. Department of
Energy's Mesoscale-to-Microscale Coupling (MMC) project, part of DOE Wind
Energy Technologies Office's Atmosphere to Electrons (A2e) initiative. These 
docs will overview the numerical models utilized within the MMC project,
provide information for running various case studies (including links to model
setups, auxiliary input, pre- and post-processing code, and assessment
notebooks), and describe the capabilities that have been developed within this
eight-year effort.
