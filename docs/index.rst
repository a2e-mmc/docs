Mesoscale-to-Microscale Coupling
================================

This documentation describes ongoing work on the Atmosphere to 
Electrons (A2e) mesoscale-to-microscale coupling (MMC) project. These 
docs will overview the numerical models utilized within the MMC project,
provide information for running various case studies 
(including model setups, auxiliary input, pre- and post-processing 
code, and assessment notebooks), and describe the capabilities that have 
been developed within this project.
