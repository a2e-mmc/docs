Mesoscale Modeling
==================

Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)
--------------------------------------
Tool for numerical weather prediction developed at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), the former Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), the Naval
Research Laboratory, the University of Oklahoma, and the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA).

Microscale Modeling
===================

Simulator fOr Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA)
--------------------------------------------
CFD tools developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) based on
the open-source OpenFOAM (Field Operation And Manipulation) platform for
simulating the microscale atmospheric boundary layer environment. Wind turbines
are modeled as actuator lines (or actuator disks) with the option to include
momentum sources to represent the wind turbine tower and nacelle. Coupling to
the NREL FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, Turbulence) model provides
comprehensive aeroservoelastic capabilities.

Nalu
----
An exascale-capable code under current development by NREL and Sandia National
Laboratories using the Sierra Toolkit and Trilinos solver. MMC capabilities
from SOWFA will be extended to Nalu in the near future.
